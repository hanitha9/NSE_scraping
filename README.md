# NSE Web Scraping with LLaMA LLM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **scraping real-time stock market data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE)** and leveraging **LLaMA LLM** for data analysis, summarization, and pattern recognition. It provides insights into stock trends, sentiment analysis, and intelligent query handling.

## 🚀 Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts live stock data, including top gainers, losers, and historical trends.
- **Data Cleaning & Structuring**: Uses LLaMA to organize and preprocess extracted data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes stock-related financial news and reports.
- **Automated Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of stock trends.
- **Intelligent Query Handling**: Processes natural language queries to fetch relevant stock data.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies historical stock trends for decision support.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **LLaMA LLM** (For NLP tasks)
- **Flask/FastAPI** (For API-based query handling)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For data analysis & visualization)

## 📂 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hanitha/NSE_scraping.git
   cd NSE_scraping
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh

4. **Start the API for query handling (if applicable):**
   ```sh
   python new1.py
   ```

## 📊 Usage
- Run the script to **scrape** and **store** real-time stock data.
- Use LLaMA-powered **query handling** to retrieve specific stock insights.
- Perform **trend analysis and sentiment classification** using LLaMA’s NLP capabilities.

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- Implement **real-time dashboard** for stock visualization.
- Integrate **deep learning** for enhanced pattern recognition.
- Expand **multi-source data scraping** (e.g., social media for sentiment analysis).
